These algorithms\nare intended to protect sensitive information well into the foreseeable future, including\nafter the advent of quantum computers. In the fourth round of the Post-Quantum Cryp-\ntography Standardization Process, NIST selected four candidate algorithms for key estab-\nlishment to be studied:  BIKE, Classic McEliece, HQC, and SIKE. This report describes the\nevaluation and selection process of these fourth-round candidates based on public feed-\nback and internal review.      The report summarizes each of the candidate algorithms and\nidentifies those selected for standardization.  The only key-establishment algorithm that\nwill be standardized is HQC, and NIST will develop a standard based on HQC to augment\nits key-establishment portfolio.\n\nKeywords\n\ncryptography; key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM); key establishment; post-quantum cryp-\ntography; quantum-resistant; quantum-safe.\n\nReports on Computer Systems Technology\n\nThe Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical\nleadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure.

    "text": "NIST IR 8545    Fourth Round Status Report\nMarch 2025\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated the Post-Quantum Cryp-\ntography (PQC) Standardization Process in December 2016 to select quantum-resistant\npublic-key cryptographic algorithms for standardization in response to the substantial de-\nvelopment and advancement of quantum computing. After three rounds of evaluation\nand analysis, NIST announced the selection of the first algorithms to be standardized [2].\nThe key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) selected for standardization was CRYSTALS-Kyber\n(ML-KEM [3]). The digital signatures selected were CRYSTALS-Dilithium (ML-DSA [4]), Fal-\ncon (FN-DSA), and SPHINCS+ (SLH-DSA [5]). For a detailed explanation of NIST’s choices,\nas well as a summary of the third round, see NIST IR 8413 [2].\nIn addition to those initial selections, NIST advanced four KEM candidates to the fourth\nround for continued evaluation: BIKE [6], Classic McEliece [7], HQC [8], and SIKE [9]. These\nalgorithms were all based on different security assumptions than ML-KEM. NIST indicated\nthat it would select one or two of the algorithms for standardization at the conclusion of\nthe fourth round.\nThe fourth round began in July 2022 and involved a thorough analysis of the theoretical\nand empirical evidence used to justify the security of the candidates. During this time, the\nsubmitters of SIKE acknowledged its insecurity and recommended against its further use.\nThe submission teams of the unbroken fourth-round candidates were invited to present\nupdates for their candidate algorithms at the Fifth NIST PQC Standardization Conference in\nRockville, Maryland, on April 10-12, 2024. The submitters participated in a joint panel to\ndiscuss the candidates’ merits, and several researchers presented work that was relevant\nto the PQC standardization process.\nThroughout the fourth round, NIST received valuable feedback from the cryptographic\ncommunity. Based on this feedback and internal reviews of the fourth-round candidates,\nNIST announced the selection of HQC in March 2025 for standardization.\nTable 1 shows a timeline of major events with respect to the NIST PQC Standardization\nProcess to date.\n\n1"

    "text": "NIST IR 8545    Fourth Round Status Report\nMarch 2025\n\n2. Evaluation Criteria and Selection Process\n\n2.1. Acceptance of the Fourth-Round Candidates\nNIST selected four candidate algorithms for the fourth round, all of which were KEMs. Clas-\nsic McEliece was a third-round finalist, and the other three algorithms were alternates [13].\nThe set of finalists included the algorithms that NIST considered to be the most promising\nto fit the majority of use cases and be ready for standardization soon after the third round.\nThe alternate candidates were regarded as potential candidates for future standardization,\nmost likely after another round of evaluation.\nThe submission teams were allowed to make minor modifications and resubmit their pack-\nages, which had to meet the same requirements as the original submissions. The complete\nupdated specifications were posted on NIST’s PQC website [15] for public review on Oc-\ntober 27, 2022.   Most of the changes focused on fixing minor issues that were identified\nduring the third round and clarifying or simplifying the submission specification. One mod-\nification of note that occurred during the fourth round is BIKE’s decoder. The thresholds\nfor the decoder were altered to reduce the risk of decryption failure. No major redesigns\nor changes were allowed.\n\nTable 2.

Evaluation Criteria\nNIST’s Call for Proposals [16] identified three broad aspects of the evaluation criteria that\nwould be used to compare candidate algorithms throughout the NIST PQC Standardiza-\ntion Process: 1) security, 2) cost and performance, and 3) algorithm and implementation\ncharacteristics. These criteria are described below, along with a discussion of how they\nimpacted the fourth-round candidate evaluations.\n\n2.2.1. Security\nAs with the previous phases of the PQC Standardization Process, security was the most im-\nportant factor that NIST considered when evaluating the fourth-round candidate schemes.\nIn the third round of the PQC Standardization Process, NIST selected one KEM — Kyber —\nthat was then standardized as ML-KEM in FIPS 203 [14]. The security of ML-KEM is based\nprimarily on the presumed hardness of certain computational problems in lattices. As dis-\ncussed in the third-round report, NIST values having a variety of computational hardness\n\n                                    4"

In pursuit of that goal, NIST selected fourth-\nround candidates whose security was based on computational assumptions that differ sig-\nnificantly from that of ML-KEM. Specifically, the candidates consisted of the isogeny-based\nKEM SIKE and the code-based KEMs BIKE, HQC, and Classic McEliece. See Table 2.\nNIST’s key-establishment standards are currently utilized in a wide variety of applications.\nThe specific properties required for a key-establishment scheme to provide security in a\ngiven application can vary. However, in terms of formal security definitions, a single no-\ntion suffices for key-establishment schemes that are intended for general use:      semantic\nsecurity with respect to adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (equivalently, IND-CCA2 se-\ncurity).       ML-KEM is believed to satisfy IND-CCA2 security and is expected to serve as a\ngeneral-purpose scheme in any application that calls for NIST-approved post-quantum key-\nestablishment.\nThe formal security statuses of the fourth-round KEM candidates vary significantly. SIKE,\nthe sole isogeny-based candidate, was broken and thus does not satisfy IND-CCA2 secu-\nrity [17]. The code-based candidates BIKE, HQC, and Classic McEliece are believed to satisfy\nIND-CCA2 security. However, NIST’s level of confidence in the IND-CCA2 security of these\nschemes is not equal. Notably, NIST has a higher level of confidence in the IND-CCA2 se-\ncurity of HQC than BIKE (see Sec. 3 for further details).\nSubmitters to the fourth round were encouraged but not required to provide proofs of IND-\nCCA2 security (from clearly stated computational assumptions) in relevant models. NIST\ndefined five security categories to compare the security strengths provided by the submis-\nsions. Submitters were asked to provide a classification of the security of the parameter\nsets of their schemes following the definitions provided in [16].\nNIST also listed other desirable security properties, such as resistance to side-channel and\nmulti-key attacks and resistance to misuse. Submissions were encouraged to note any ad-\nditional desirable security properties that they provided. Finally, NIST required submission\npackages to summarize known cryptanalytic attacks on the scheme and complexity esti-\nmates for those attacks.\n\n2.2.2. Cost and Performance\nThe second-most important criterion when evaluating candidate algorithms was their per-\nformance characteristics:\n • Sizes of encapsulation keys and ciphertexts\n • Computational efficiencies of encapsulations, decapsulations, and key generations\n       (i.e., the speeds of the algorithms)\nTables 3 through 5 show representative benchmarks for key generations, encapsulations,\nand decapsulations of BIKE, HQC, and Classic McEliece, respectively.

When the size differences between HQC and BIKE\ndo not affect the protocol execution time, the protocol runs faster with HQC. When the\ndifferences affect the protocol execution time noticeably, BIKE is more attractive than HQC.\nFor TLS, BIKE would likely be more attractive than HQC over the web.

The third round included\nreal-world experiments to identify potential performance problems with the algorithms.\nThese experiments continued into the fourth round with a greater focus on HQC and BIKE\n(see Sec. 2.2.2).\nNIST believes it is important to select cryptographic standards that will be capable of pro-\ntecting sensitive government information as well as being widely adopted for use in in-\ndustry. In selecting a cryptographic algorithm for standardization, an evaluation factor\nis whether a patent might hinder the adoption of a cryptographic standard. All submis-\nsion teams were required to submit statements regarding knowledge of patents involving\ntheir algorithms and implementations, which are available on the NIST PQC fourth round\nsubmissions website [23]. The submitters of HQC indicated two patents that could po-\ntentially be relevant to an implementation of HQC. However, the patent owner committed\nand agreed to grant to any interested party on a worldwide basis a non-exclusive license for\nthe purpose of implementing the standard without compensation and under reasonable\nterms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.1\n\n2.3. Selection of the Candidates for Standardization\nIn relative order of importance, NIST considered the security, cost and performance, and\nalgorithm and implementation characteristics of the candidates in selecting what to stan-\ndardize.

Responses noted that Classic McEliece may provide better per-\nformance than BIKE or HQC for applications in which a public key can be transferred once\nand then used for several encapsulations (e.g., file encryption and virtual private networks\n[VPNs]) due to its small ciphertext size and fast encapsulation and decapsulation. There\nwas also some interest in Classic McEliece based on the perception that it is a conservative\nchoice. However, the interest expressed in Classic McEliece was limited, and having more\nstandards to implement adds complexity to protocols and PQC migration.\nClassic McEliece is currently under consideration for standardization by the International\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO). Concurrent standardization of Classic McEliece by\nNIST and ISO risks the creation of incompatible standards. After the ISO standardization\nprocess has been completed, NIST may consider developing a standard for Classic McEliece\nbased on the ISO standard. However, Classic McEliece is no longer under consideration for\nstandardization as part of the current NIST PQC Standardization Process.\nAt the end of the third round, NIST indicated its intent to standardize at most one of BIKE\nor HQC for use as a general-purpose KEM [2]. As specified in the Call for Proposals [22],\nsubmitted KEMs were evaluated based on how well they appear to provide IND-CCA2 se-\ncurity, particularly for KEMs intended for general use. While NIST has confidence in the in-\ndistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) security of BIKE and HQC, both\nschemes require a sufficiently low decryption failure rate (DFR) in order to be IND-CCA2-\nsecure. There is evidence that HQC has a sufficiently low DFR and recent work indicates\nthat with minor modifications, BIKE achieves the same [26]. However, NIST does not con-\nsider the DFR analysis for BIKE to be as mature as that for HQC. Additionally, HQC is not\nbelieved to require additional modifications to achieve the desired security properties.\nGiven the critical need for strong IND-CCA2 security in a general-purpose KEM, HQC was\nselected for standardization.\nIn summary, NIST has only selected HQC for standardization. The algorithms that were\nnot selected are not under consideration for standardization by NIST as part of the current\nNIST PQC Standardization Process.\n\n9"

Summary of the Fourth-Round Candidates\n\nThis section describes each of the fourth-round candidates, including their advantages and\ndisadvantages and why a scheme was selected for standardization or not.\nSection 3 of IR 8413[2] introduces some computational and security concepts and history\nthat might be referenced throughout the subsequent subsections. The provided informa-\ntion reduced redundancy, as some of the candidates’ security analyses have properties\nin common. The information was not intended to be an exhaustive security or literature\nreview.\n\n3.1. HQC\nHQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic) is a KEM based on quasi-cyclic codes, where no trapdoor is\nhidden in the code [27]. It was designed to leverage the structural advantages of quasi-\ncyclic codes while maintaining a more direct security reduction to the problem of decod-\ning a random linear code. Unlike the other code-based candidates, the only coding-theory\nhardness assumptions required by HQC’s security proof are parameterizations of the de-\ncisional Quasi-Cyclic Syndrome Decoding (QCSD) assumption. BIKE additionally assumes\nthe hardness of Quasi-Cyclic Codeword Finding (QCCF), and Classic McEliece requires as-\nsumptions concerning binary Goppa codes [27, 28].\n\nDesign. HQC is similar in structure to Learning with Errors (LWE)-based cryptosystems, like\nRegev [29], LPR (Lyubashevsky, Peikert, Regev) [30], and ML-KEM [14]. The IND-CPA-secure\npublic-key encryption (PKE) can be described as follows.\nLet R = F2[x]/(xn − 1) for n prime such that xn − 1 has only two irreducible factors modulo\n2. The secret key is a randomly sampled pair (x, y) ∈ R2, and the public key is the pair\n(h, s = x + h · y), where h is randomly sampled from R. Because the secret key is generated\nindependently of the underlying quasi-cyclic code, there is no hidden structure in the HQC\npublic parity-check matrix.  This enables the security reduction to be independent of the\ndecoding algorithm used for decryption [27]. In addition to h, the public key includes a\npublic generator matrix G ∈ Fk×n for a concatenated Reed-Muller Reed-Solomon (RMRS)\ncode. The structure of this  2\n                             code is assumed to be visible to all parties.\nTo encrypt a message m ∈ Fk, the sender randomly samples three polynomials e, r1, r2 ∈ R\nof appropriate low weights 2\n                             and responds with the ciphertext\n\n                         c = (u, v) := (r1 + h · r2, mG + s · r2 + e).    (1)\n\nTo decrypt, the receiver uses the decoding algorithm for an RMRS code to decode (v − u · y).\n\nSecurity. The IND-CPA security of HQC relies on the difficulty of the QCSD with parity prob-\nlem. Applying the Fujisaki Okamoto (FO) transform [31] to the CPA-secure PKE achieves an\nIND-CCA2 KEM.\n\n                              10"

A sufficiently low DFR is required for the IND-CCA2\nsecurity proof of the relevant FO⊥ transform [31] to be valid and to prevent key-recovery\nattacks in a key-pair-reuse setting [32].\nAs with the other code-based schemes, the best known attacks are based on information\nset decoding.\n\nPerformance.      The quasi-cyclic structure of HQC enables small public-key and ciphertext\nsizes, although they are noticeably larger than the structured lattice KEMs.                  HQC cipher-\ntexts and public keys are roughly 2.9 and 1.5 times the size of BIKE ciphertexts and public\nkeys, respectively (see Tables 6 and 7).\nAlthough the bandwidth of HQC exceeds that of BIKE, HQC’s key generation and decap-\nsulation are significantly faster than those of BIKE (see Tables 3 and 4). As a result, the\nperformances of HQC and BIKE in applications are difficult to compare.                     Experiments on\nTLS 1.3 handshake performance under varying network conditions have revealed that HQC\noutperforms BIKE under ideal network conditions [33].                     However, in the case of nonzero\npacket loss rates, BIKE outperforms HQC. In addition to the benchmarks included in the\nHQC submission for a hardware implementation, there have been several hardware im-\nplementation results published in the literature [34–36].\nSignificant events since Round 3. To address security and performance, HQC added a salt\nto mitigate multi-ciphertext attacks and switched to using implicit rejection for their FO\ntransform. Additionally, several changes to the implementation were made to avoid timing\nattacks.\n\nOverall assessment. NIST determined that HQC would provide a good complement to ML-\nKEM, since it is based on a different underlying security problem and still retains reasonable\nperformance characteristics for general applications.                  The only other fourth-round candi-\ndate that could potentially serve this purpose was BIKE, which relies on similar code-based\nassumptions to HQC. Compared to BIKE, HQC has larger public key and ciphertext sizes but\ncheaper key generation and decryption. NIST was unable to make a definitive assessment\nas to which performance profile is better but found it likely that either performance profile\nwould be acceptable for most general applications.\nThe decisive factor in favor of HQC relative to BIKE is HQC’s stable DFR analysis. A suffi-\nciently low DFR is required to achieve IND-CCA2 security, and there have been persistent\nuncertainties regarding BIKE’s DFR. While DFR estimation techniques for BIKE have recently\n\n2HQC’s DFR analysis makes the simplifying assumption that the coordinates of e′ = x · r2 − r1 · y + e are\nindependent variables.

BIKE\n\nBIKE (Bit-Flipping Key Encapsulation) is a KEM based on binary linear quasi-cyclic moderate\ndensity parity check (QC-MDPC) codes [37]. The BIKE cryptosystem was initially designed\nfor ephemeral key use but now claims to also support static key use.\n\nDesign.   The binary linear QC-MDPC code C(n, k) used in BIKE is constructed as follows.\nThe secret key is a parity check matrix Hr×2r for a quasi-cyclic moderate density parity\ncheck code composed of two circulant blocks, where r is prime and chosen so that xr−1\nhas only two irreducible factors modulo 2. Each row of H has Hamming weight w ≈ √n,\nwhere w ≡ 2 mod 4 . All matrix operations in BIKE can be viewed as polynomial operations\ndue to the isomorphism between the ring of v × v circulant matrices and the polynomial\nring F2[x]/(xv + 1) for any v ∈ N. The secret key may then be thought of as a 1 × 2 module\n(h0, h1). The public key Hpub = (1, h−1h1) is the secret key in systematic form, which is\ncomputed by multiplying H by h−1.         0\n             0\nThe underlying BIKE PKE follows Niederreiter-style encryption. At a high level, a message\nis encoded as an error vector e of weight t , and the corresponding ciphertext is computed\nas HpubeT . Decryption is accomplished by multiplying the ciphertext by h0 to produce the\nsyndrome HeT and then using the recommended Black-Grey-Flip bit-flipping decoder [38]\nto recover e.\n\nSecurity. The proof of IND-CPA security of the underlying PKE in the random oracle model\n(ROM) depends on the difficulty of solving the decisional QCSD and QCCF problems. The\nFO transform, as described in [31], is applied to the CPA-secure PKE to achieve a claimed\nIND-CCA2 KEM. The PKE must be δ -correct3 for δ ≤ 2−λ to apply this transformation.\nIterative bit-flipping decoders for QC-MDPC codes are difficult to analyze in closed form,\nand the anticipated DFR is too low to compute directly. Moreover, the DFR of MDPC and\nLDPC codes under iterative decoding follows two regimes: a waterfall region in which de-\ncoding failures decrease rapidly followed by an error floor region in which decoding failures\ndecrease at a much slower pace as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Understanding the\n3A KEM is δ -correct if the decapsulation fails (i.e., disagrees with encapsulation) with probability at most δ\non average over all keys and messages. Similarly, a decoder will be δ -correct if its failure rate is at most δ on\naverage when the input is drawn uniformly.\n\n                                           12"

    "text": "NIST IR 8545    Fourth Round Status Report\nMarch 2025\n\nDFR of BIKE has remained an open problem during the fourth round. Analyzing the BIKE\nDFR has involved studying the impacts of weak keys and near codewords on decoding per-\nformance.\nThe first classification of weak keys for QC-MDPC codes was given in [39] and generalized\nin [40, 41]. Since these classes of weak keys have small cardinality, they were determined\nto have minimal impact on the overall BIKE DFR. A new class of weak keys was discovered\n[42] based on the gathering property. These weak keys were shown to cause an average\nDFR of a least 2−117 for BIKE level 1 parameters, defeating the IND-CCA2 security of BIKE.\nThe BIKE team studied the weak keys with the gathering property and found that the de-\ncoding failures were largely caused by incorrect flips happening early in the decoding pro-\ncess. Namely, bits not in error were incorrectly flipped during the first iterations of the de-\ncoder. To mitigate the effect of the gathering keys, the BIKE team introduced a new decoder\nknown as BIKE-flip that sets a high bit-flipping threshold at the first decoding iteration and\nthen gradually lowers the threshold throughout decoding [6]. Results indicated that the\nBIKE-flip decoder significantly reduced the impact of gathering keys, although this analysis\nwas limited to classes of weak keys with a high enough DFR to be directly measured. Sub-\nsequently, a model introduced by [26] was able to predict variations in DFR based on the\nstructure of a key. This would allow a modification of the BIKE key-generation algorithm in\nwhich keys that are not expected to have a typical value for the DFR are rejected.\nNear codewords are error vectors of low weight (u) that map to syndromes of low weight (v)\nand are well-studied in the LDPC literature as impediments to the iterative decoding pro-\ncess. Moreover, these vectors are known to significantly contribute to error floor behavior.\nA particular class of near codewords, where u = v = w , was defined in [41] and shown to\nexist for BIKE. The impact of these near codewords  2\n                                                    on the decoding performance for BIKE\nwas initially analyzed in [41] and further studied in [26]. In [26], a Markov model that\ntracked proximity to near codewords was used to predict the error floors for QC-MDPC\ncodes under a generic iterative decoder. Results indicated that the error floor behavior\nin the BIKE DFR curves was dominated by convergence to these near codewords during\nfailed decoding instances [26]. Furthermore, the model predicted that increasing BIKE se-\ncurity level 1 block lengths from r = 12323 to r = 13477 would result in a conservative DFR\nestimate of 2−129.5 for typical keys.\n\nPerformance. The sizes of BIKE’s public keys and ciphertexts were roughly 70% and 30%\nof HQC’s, respectively. However, BIKE’s decapsulation and key-generation algorithms were\nroughly 5-6 times slower than HQC’s, respectively.  The performance of BIKE and HQC in\napplications was difficult to compare. Experiments on TLS 1.3 handshake performance\nunder varying network conditions have revealed that HQC outperforms BIKE under ideal\nnetwork conditions [33]. However, BIKE outperforms HQC when non-zero packet loss rates\nare introduced.\n\n13"

The BIKE specification was updated at the beginning of\nthe fourth round and included a change from the previous approach of sampling fixed-\nweight vectors to a data-oblivious technique.                  This modification had no noticeable per-\nformance impacts but eliminated certain side-channel attacks.                  To offer more resistance\nagainst multi-target key attacks, BIKE’s FO transform to attain IND-CCA2 security now in-\ncludes a hash of part of the public key.                  As noted in the Security section above, a new\ndecoder (BIKE-Flips) was used, which has better resilience to decryption failure for weak\nkeys.\n\nOverall assessment. NIST found that BIKE is a KEM that would complement ML-KEM well\nwith respect to having a different underlying security problem and balanced performance\ncharacteristics. BIKE also offers smaller keys and ciphertexts than HQC. NIST reviewed sev-\neral DFR analyses of BIKE, including recent results indicating that an approximate 9% in-\ncrease in block size leads to a sufficiently low DFR for security level 1 parameters. Despite\nthese promising results, NIST found the security analysis of HQC to be more mature and\nstable than that of BIKE. As such, NIST has not selected BIKE for standardization.\n\n3.3. Classic McEliece\nDesign. Classic McEliece is a code-based KEM that uses binary Goppa codes in the Nieder-\nreiter variant of the McEliece cryptosystem combined with standard techniques to achieve\nIND-CCA2 security. Due to the use of Goppa codes, the KEM has perfect correctness.4 It\nis a merger of the second-round submissions Classic McEliece and NTS-KEM. The original\nMcEliece cryptosystem was published in [43] and was also based on binary Goppa codes.\n\nSecurity. The Classic McEliece submission cites [44] and other results as giving a tight proof\nof the submitted KEM’s IND-CCA2 security in the quantum random oracle model based on\nthe assumption that the 1978 McEliece scheme provides one-way under chosen-plaintext\nattacks (OW-CPA) security. Confidence in the security of the 1978 scheme was mostly es-\ntablished based on the scheme’s long history of surviving cryptanalysis with only minor\nchanges in the complexity of the best-known attack.                  Alternatively, the security of the\nscheme could be established under the assumptions that row-reduced parity check ma-\ntrices for the binary Goppa codes used by Classic McEliece are indistinguishable from row-\nreduced parity check matrices for random linear codes of the same dimensions and that\nthe syndrome decoding problem is hard for random linear codes with those dimensions.\nThe state of the art in cryptanalysis does not contradict these assumptions, although binary\nGoppa codes with very different dimensions from those used by the Classic McEliece sub-\nmission have been shown to be distinguishable from random codes [45]. More recent work\n[46] has proposed a distinguisher that claims to asymptotically break the indistinguishabil-\n\n4A perfectly correct KEM or PKE is one for which every ciphertext generated using the encapsulation/encryp-\ntion function may be correctly decrypted using the decapsulation/decryption function. In contrast, some\nKEMs and PKEs have a very small decryption failure rate.\n\n                                         14"

    "text": "NIST IR 8545    Fourth Round Status Report\nMarch 2025\n\nity of Goppa codes with parameters that are similar to those used by Classic McEliece but\nthat target a much higher security level.\nA number of approaches to the cryptanalysis of Classic McEliece have been studied. The\nmost effective known attacks and those used to set the parameters of Classic McEliece are\ninformation set decoding attacks, which are similar to the best-known attacks against BIKE\nand HQC. Unlike the other two schemes, information set decoding is only applicable to\nmessage recovery, not key recovery. These attacks ignore the structure of the binary code\nand seek to recover the error vector based on its low Hamming weight. These techniques\noriginated with Prange’s algorithm in 1962 [47] and have undergone a series of improve-\nments [48–56]. However, the net effect of these improvements has been fairly modest,\nand most of the change in concrete security is due to improvements that were discovered\nmore than 30 years ago. Quantum versions of information set decoding (ISD) algorithms\nhave also been studied [57]. These results represent a generic Grover-based speedup of\nclassical ISD algorithms and indicate that ISD algorithms can be sped up nearly as much\nas brute force search problems. In a multi-ciphertext setting, a further improvement [58]\ncan reduce the cost of decoding a single ciphertext by a factor equal to approximately the\nsquare root of the number of ciphertexts.\nKey-recovery attacks have also been studied, which attempt to find the private key by al-\ngebraic techniques or brute-force searches. Algebraic techniques have been used to break\nvariants of McEliece based on other algebraic codes [59–63] or Goppa codes with addi-\ntional structure imposed [64], but they appear to be significantly more costly than ISD for\nattacking the parameters submitted for Classic McEliece. Nonetheless, algebraic attacks\nthat target the structure of Goppa codes and achieve either key recovery or a distinguisher\nfrom a random linear code have remained an active area of research [46, 65–69].\n\nPerformance. Classic McEliece has a very large public-key size and fairly slow key gener-\nation, which will likely make it undesirable in many common settings. However, its pro-\nfile could have some advantages in settings where a public key is reused many times and\ndoes not need to be retransmitted for each new communication [70]. In particular, Classic\nMcEliece has the smallest ciphertext sizes of any of the NIST PQC candidates.\n\nSignificant events since Round 3. At the beginning of the fourth round, the submission team\nintroduced a modification to the FO transform to incorporate implicit rejection without\nplaintext confirmation. This tweak aimed to reduce the potential for patent concerns and\nsimplify the specification and software code.\nDuring the fourth round, there has been significant progress in cryptanalysis techniques\nthat are applicable to key recovery and the related problem of distinguishing a Goppa code\nfrom a random linear code [46, 66–69]. While these techniques are still far from concretely\naffecting the security of the submitted parameter sets of Classic McEliece, they somewhat\nweaken the argument that the long-term security of Classic McEliece is guaranteed by its\nlong history of cryptanalysis.\n\n                                         15"

This con-\ncurrent standardization effort remains active and ongoing.\n\nOverall assessment. NIST remains confident in the security of Classic McEliece,5 although\nrecent progress in cryptanalysis somewhat undermines the case for treating it as an espe-\ncially conservative choice. Its large public-key size makes Classic McEliece an unattractive\nchoice for most common applications, but it offers an excellent performance profile for\napplications that are sensitive to ciphertext size, where public keys are rarely transmitted.\nNIST does not find the case for standardizing Classic McEliece compelling, due to skepticism\nthat it will see widespread use.                       In the event that Classic McEliece does become widely\nused through other standards, and that NIST remains confident in its security while also\ndetermining that there is sufficient need, NIST may develop a NIST standard based on the\nwidely used version.\n\n3.4. SIKE\nCryptographic schemes that are based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem\non elliptic curves are known to be quantum-insecure because of Shor’s algorithm.                        How-\never, elliptic curves can be used in a different way to construct PKE and KEM protocols. An\nisogeny from one elliptic curve to another elliptic curve (over the same field) is a rational\nmap that is also a group homomorphism. Given two isogenous curves E and E ′, efficiently\nconstructing an isogeny from E to E ′ is generally unknown. The assumed hardness of find-\ning an isogeny between two elliptic curves combined with the Diffie–Hellman model for\nkey exchange enables the construction of a family of isogeny-based KEMs.\nSIKE is a KEM based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves that follows and improves\nupon the construction known as Supersingular Isogeny Diffie–Hellman (SIDH) [72]. In SIKE,\none party prepares a secret isogeny φ from a publicly known elliptic curve E0 to a new curve\nE and computes the images of the generators of a known torsion subgroup (under φ ) as\nthe public key. This public key is then used to carry out a Diffie–Hellman procedure. The\nsecurity of SIKE depends crucially on the assumption that it is infeasible for an adversary\nto compute the secret isogeny φ from public information.\nHowever, in mid-2022, researchers showed that the secret isogeny φ can be efficiently\nrecovered from the public key [17]. Attacks on SIKE were further improved and general-\nized by other researchers [25, 73], and the authors of SIKE have acknowledged the break\n[9]. Attempts to patch the vulnerabilities were ineffective or had weaknesses in some in-\nstances [74].                       While these attacks were devastating for SIKE, they do not apply to many\n\n5Independent estimates [56, 71] of the cost of information set decoding algorithms have long suggested that\nClassic McEliece’s parameter sets (i.e., mceliece460896 and mceliece460896f) that claim Category 3 security\nfall short of their security target. However, NIST remains confident that these parameter sets at least meet\nthe criteria for Category 2 security.\n\n                                     16"
