    "text": "        NIST IR 8547 ipd (Initial Public Draft)    Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards\n        November 2024\n\n 88     1. Introduction\n 89     Cryptographic algorithms are vital for safeguarding confidential electronic information from\n 90     unauthorized access. For decades, these algorithms have proved strong enough to defend\n 91     against attacks using conventional computers that attempt to defeat cryptography. However,\n 92     future quantum computing may be able to break these algorithms, rendering data and\n 93     information vulnerable. Countering this future quantum capability requires new cryptographic\n 94     methods that can protect data from both current conventional computers and the quantum\n 95     computers of tomorrow. These methods are referred to as post-quantum cryptography (PQC).\n 96     In response, NIST has released three PQC standards to start the next and significantly large\n 97     stage of working on the transition to post-quantum cryptography: the Module-Lattice-Based\n 98     Key-Encapsulation Mechanism [FIPS203], the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm\n 99     [FIPS204], and the Stateless Hash-Based Signature Algorithm [FIPS205]. Historically, the journey\n100     from algorithm standardization to full integration into information systems can take 10 to 20\n101     years. This timeline reflects the complexity of companies building the algorithms into products\n102     and services, procuring those products and services, and integrating those products and\n103     services into technology infrastructures.\n104     Even though the transition to post-quantum cryptography is starting before a cryptographically\n105     relevant quantum computer has been built, there is a pressing threat. Encrypted data remains\n106     at risk because of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat in which adversaries collect encrypted\n107     data now with the goal of decrypting it once quantum technology matures. Since sensitive data\n108     often retains its value for many years, starting the transition to post-quantum cryptography\n109     now is critical to preventing these future breaches. This threat model is one of the main reasons\n110     why the transition to post-quantum cryptography is urgent.\n\n111     1.1. Scope and Purpose\n112     Updating cryptographic technology has occurred many times at different scales, such as\n113     increasing key sizes or phasing out insecure hash functions and block ciphers. While the\n114     transition to PQC is unprecedented in scale, it benefits from a level of awareness and\n115     understanding that previous cryptographic changes did not have. NIST recognizes the\n116     complexity of migrating the vast array of systems that currently rely on public-key cryptography\n117     and acknowledges that this transition will demand substantial effort across diverse applications\n118     and infrastructures with specific requirements and constraints.\n119     This report serves as the initial step in a broader strategy to manage and guide the transition to\n120     post-quantum cryptography. This transition will involve the adoption of new PQC algorithms as\n121     well as the careful deprecation, controlled legacy use, and eventual removal of quantum-\n122     vulnerable algorithms that are currently widespread in technological infrastructures. Public-\n123     private engagement will be crucial on the path toward PQC. Additionally, this report continues\n124     NIST’s ongoing dialogue with industry, standards organizations, and relevant agencies to\n125     develop a clear roadmap and realistic timeline for transitioning to PQC. NIST is committed to\n\n   1"

Cryptographic Standards\n138     Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-series\n139     specify a broad set of cryptographic primitives, algorithms, and schemes, including many public-\n140     key cryptosystems that will be deprecated and ultimately disallowed as part of the transition to\n141     post-quantum cryptography. This section identifies quantum-vulnerable algorithms in NIST’s\n142     existing cryptographic standards as well as the post-quantum algorithm standards that have\n143     been recently published. Section 4.1 provides the transition plan for the quantum-vulnerable\n144     algorithms in these standards.\n\n145     2.1.1. Digital Signature Algorithms\n146     Digital signature algorithms are used to provide identity authentication, integrity\n147     authentication, source authentication, and support for non-repudiation. Digital signature\n148     algorithms are used in conjunction with hash functions or eXtendable-Output Functions (XOFs)\n149     to sign messages of arbitrary length.\n150     NIST-approved digital signature algorithms were historically specified in FIPS 186 [FIPS186]. The\n151     current revision of FIPS 186 specifies the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and\n152     adopts the RSA algorithm specified in RFC 8017 and PKCS 1 (version 1.5 and higher) and the\n153     Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) specified in RFC 8032. The related SP 800-\n154     186 [SP800186] specifies the elliptic curves to be used with ECDSA and the elliptic curve\n155     cryptography (ECC) based key establishment schemes in SP 800-56A [SP80056A]. These\n156     algorithms are vulnerable to Shor’s Algorithm on a cryptographically relevant quantum\n157     computer.\n158     FIPS 204 and 205 each specify quantum-resistant digital signature schemes. FIPS 204 specifies\n159     the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) [FIPS204], which is derived\n160     from the CRYSTALS-Dilithium submission. FIPS 205 specifies the Stateless Hash-Based Digital\n161     Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA), which is derived from the SPHINCS+ submission [FIPS205].\n162     SP 800-208, Recommendation for Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes, specifies two stateful\n163     hash-based signature (HBS) schemes — the Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) system and the\n164     eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) — along with their multi-tree variants, the\n165     Hierarchical Signature System (HSS) and multi-tree XMSS (XMSSᴹᵀ) [SP800208]. These schemes\n166     are also resistant to attacks by quantum computers. In stateful hash-based signature (HBS)\n167     schemes, the HBS private key consists of a large set of one-time signature (OTS) private keys.\n168     The security of these schemes relies on the signer to ensure that no individual OTS key is ever\n169     used to sign more than one message. Due to this need to maintain state, HBS schemes are not\n170     intended for general use.\n171     In the future, NIST intends to develop a FIPS that specifies a digital signature algorithm derived\n172     from FALCON as an additional alternative to these standards. In addition, NIST is evaluating\n173     other proposed digital signature algorithms for possible standardization through the Additional\n\n3"

Key Establishment\n177     Key establishment is the means by which keys are generated and provided to the entities that\n178     are authorized to use them. Current NIST-approved key-establishment schemes are specified in\n179     SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Discrete\n180     Logarithm-Based Cryptography [SP80056A], and SP 800-56B, Recommendation for Pair-Wise\n181     Key Establishment Schemes Using Integer Factorization Cryptography [SP80056B].\n182     SP 800-56A specifies key-establishment schemes based on the discrete logarithm problem over\n183     finite fields and elliptic curves, including several variations of Diffie-Hellman and Menezes-Qu-\n184     Vanstone (MQV) key establishment schemes.\n185     SP 800-56B specifies key-establishment schemes based on the RSA public key cryptosystem.\n186     This publication includes approved methods for both key agreement and key transport.\n187     FIPS 203 specifies a cryptographic scheme called Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation\n188     Mechanism (ML-KEM), which is derived from the CRYSTALS-KYBER submission. A key-\n189     encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is a particular type of key-establishment scheme that can be\n190     used to establish a shared secret key between two parties communicating over a public\n191     channel. The fourth round of the NIST PQC Standardization process is evaluating additional KEM\n192     algorithms, and NIST anticipates selecting one or more alternatives to ML-KEM in the future.\n\n193     2.1.3. Symmetric Cryptography\n194     Symmetric-key algorithms (sometimes called secret-key algorithms) use a single key to both\n195     apply cryptographic protection and to remove or check the protection (i.e., the same key is\n196     used for a cryptographic operation and its inverse). For example, the key used to encrypt data\n197     (i.e., apply protection) is also used to decrypt the encrypted data (i.e., remove the protection).\n198     In the case of encryption, the original data is called the plaintext, while the encrypted form of\n199     the data is called the ciphertext. The key must be kept secret if the data is to remain protected.\n200     Several classes of symmetric-key algorithms have been approved: those based on block cipher\n201     algorithms (e.g., AES) and those based on the use of hash functions (e.g., a keyed-hash message\n202     authentication code based on a hash function).\n203     Symmetric-key algorithms are used for:\n204      •  Block ciphers\n205      •  Hash functions\n206      •  Encryption using block cipher modes of operation\n207      •  Data authentication using block cipher modes of operation\n208      •  Data authentication using key-hash constructions\n\n4"

NIST does not expect to need to transition away\n214     from these standards as part of the PQC migration.\n\n215     2.2. Cryptographic Technologies and Components\n216     Once PQC algorithms have been standardized, applications will need to be modified to make\n217     use of them. Many applications include components that are based on standardized protocols\n218     and security technologies that will need to be revised to support the use of the PQC algorithms.\n219     In addition, applications are built on top of software cryptographic libraries that either provide\n220     the implementations of the cryptographic algorithms or provide an interface to hardware\n221     cryptographic modules. Any software cryptographic libraries and hardware cryptographic\n222     modules used by an application will also need to be revised to support the PQC algorithms.\n223     Applications may also rely upon infrastructure components, such as public key infrastructures\n224     (PKI), that would need to be updated to support the PQC algorithms before the applications\n225     themselves can migrate to using the PQC algorithms.\n\n226     2.2.1. Network Protocol and Security Technology Standards\n227     Network protocols and security technology standards define the rules for data exchange over\n228     networks and ensure secure and reliable communication. Examples include Transport Layer\n229     Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), and Cryptographic Message\n230     Syntax (CMS).\n231     These protocols and security technologies often rely on classical cryptographic algorithms that\n232     are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Updating them to incorporate PQC algorithms is essential to\n233     maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. This involves revising protocol specifications to\n234     support new key exchange mechanisms and authentication methods that are quantum-\n235     resistant. In some cases, this will involve simply assigning an identifier for the new algorithm. In\n236     other cases, more significant changes will be required to accommodate the larger sizes of the\n237     PQC algorithms or as a result of the new algorithms having different interfaces.\n\n238     2.2.2. Software Cryptographic Libraries\n239     Software cryptographic libraries are collections of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that\n240     are implemented in software to provide essential cryptographic functions to applications.\n241     OpenSSL, BoringSSL, Libsodium, and the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) are a few\n242     examples of cryptographic libraries that are used to provide cryptographic support for\n243     applications.\n\n5"

This transition involves adding\n247     new algorithms, optimizing their implementations for performance, and ensuring those\n248     implementations are secure against side-channel attacks.\n\n249     2.2.3. Cryptographic Hardware\n250     Cryptographic hardware modules, such as hardware security modules (HSMs) and Trusted\n251     Platform Modules (TPMs), provide secure environments for performing cryptographic\n252     operations and storing sensitive keys. They are used in various applications, from securing\n253     server infrastructure to protecting cryptographic keys on personal devices.\n254     Hardware modules must be upgraded or redesigned to support PQC algorithms, which often\n255     have larger key sizes and different computational requirements. This includes updating\n256     firmware or hardware to handle new algorithms and ensuring that the modules can perform\n257     quantum-resistant cryptographic operations efficiently while maintaining the high security\n258     standards expected of these devices.\n\n259     2.2.4. PKI and Other Infrastructure Components\n260     Public key infrastructure (PKI) systems manage digital certificates and public-private key pairs to\n261     enable secure communication and authentication across networks. Other infrastructure\n262     components include certification authorities (CAs), registration authorities, key management\n263     systems, and directory services.\n264     PKI components must be updated to issue, distribute, and manage certificates that use PQC\n265     algorithms and to sign certificates and revocation status information using PQC algorithms. This\n266     includes supporting new cryptographic algorithms in certificate issuance processes and\n267     modifying validation and revocation mechanisms. Ensuring backward compatibility and\n268     interoperability during the transition period is crucial to maintaining trust and security across\n269     the network.\n\n270     2.2.5. IT Applications and Services\n271     IT applications and services encompass a wide array of software and platforms used by\n272     organizations, including web applications, databases, communication tools, cloud services, and\n273     enterprise software. These applications rely on cryptography for securing data, authenticating\n274     users, and ensuring secure transactions.\n275     Applications and services must be modified to support PQC algorithms for encryption, digital\n276     signatures, and key exchange. This requires updating the underlying cryptographic\n277     implementations, adjusting to changes in key sizes and algorithm performance, and ensuring\n278     compatibility with updated protocols and libraries. Developers need to refactor code, conduct\n279     extensive testing, and potentially redesign user interfaces to accommodate these changes.\n\n6"

Migration Considerations\n281     Even though there are no existing cryptographically relevant quantum computers that currently\n282     threaten levels of security, it will take a significant amount of time to transition to new post-\n283     quantum algorithms. Past cryptographic migrations have taken over a decade, and this more\n284     complex migration will likely take at least that long.\n285     Mosca’s theorem emphasizes the urgency of migrating to post-quantum algorithms by\n286     introducing a simple but powerful timeline: if “X” represents the number of years that data\n287     must be kept secure, and “Y” is the estimated time needed to complete the transition, then\n288     organizations must start transitioning to post-quantum algorithms before X + Y exceeds the\n289     expected time Z for a cryptographically relevant quantum computer to be built. This means that\n290     even if quantum computers are a decade away, organizations must begin the migration to post-\n291     quantum cryptography today to avoid having their encrypted data exposed once quantum\n292     computers become operational in the future. This threat, often referred to as “harvest now,\n293     decrypt later,” underscores the necessity of acting immediately, especially for data with long-\n294     term sensitivity, such as government secrets or medical records. Ensuring security today will\n295     safeguard it for the future.\n\n296     3.1. Use Cases\n\n297     3.1.1. Code Signing\n298     Code signing involves digitally signing executables and software packages to verify the author’s\n299     identity and ensure that the code has not been tampered with. This process is critical for\n300     maintaining trust in software distribution channels and preventing the spread of malicious\n301     code.\n302     The devices that install and execute this code need the ability to verify the signatures on the\n303     code. In some cases, it is not feasible to update the code that performs the signature\n304     verification after the devices have been manufactured. When this is the case, it is important for\n305     the devices to be designed to require quantum-resistant signatures on the executables, if there\n306     is a risk that the devices will still be in use after cryptographically relevant quantum computers\n307     become available.\n\n308     3.1.2. User and Machine Authentication\n309     User and machine authentication systems verify identities to control access to resources. This\n310     often involves cryptographic protocols that use asymmetric algorithms for secure key exchange\n311     and authentication, ensuring that only authorized users or devices can access sensitive data or\n312     services. Depending on the protocol, authentication may be performed using either a digital\n313     signature algorithm or a key-establishment scheme.\n314     Unlike with encryption, where there is a threat of “harvest now, decrypt later,” an\n315     authentication system remains secure as long as the cryptographic algorithms and keys used to\n316     perform the authentication are secure when the authentication is performed.

It may also require obtaining hardware cryptographic tokens that\n323     support the quantum-resistant algorithms.\n\n324     3.1.3. Network Security Protocols\n325     Network security protocols like TLS and virtual private networks secure data transmission over\n326     public networks. They use cryptographic techniques to provide confidentiality, integrity, and\n327     authentication between communicating parties.\n328     Modern network security protocols tend to use separate asymmetric keys for key\n329     establishment and authentication. While long-term keys are used for authentication, key-\n330     establishment keys are used for a short period of time, usually for a single key establishment.\n331     This provides the property of forward secrecy, where the compromise of a long-term key does\n332     not result in the compromise of communication sessions that occurred before the compromise.\n333     As symmetric keys that are established through the key-establishment process are used to\n334     provide confidentiality, the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat needs to be considered when\n335     determining a migration timeline for the key-establishment scheme. The cryptographic\n336     algorithm used for authentication may be transitioned at a different time, and for that the\n337     considerations in Sec. 3.1.2 apply.\n\n338     3.1.4. Email and Document Signing and Encryption\n339     Email and document signing employ digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of\n340     electronic communications and documents. Common algorithms like RSA and ECDSA are widely\n341     used to create a cryptographic binding between the content and the sender’s identity, ensuring\n342     that the message has not been altered and that it originates from a legitimate source.\n343     Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is a standard for public-key encryption\n344     and the signing of MIME data. It provides end-to-end encryption and authentication for email\n345     and file exchanges to ensure that only intended recipients can access the content. As with other\n346     applications providing data confidentiality, email encryption is subject to “harvest now, decrypt\n347     later.”\n\n348     3.2. PQC-Classical Hybrid Protocols\n349     The migration to post-quantum cryptography may initially include hybrid solutions that\n350     incorporate the use of quantum-resistant and quantum-vulnerable algorithms when\n351     establishing cryptographic keys or generating digital signatures. These hybrid solutions are\n352     typically designed to remain secure if at least one of the component algorithms is secure.\n\n8"

It may also provide a path for\n355     accommodating the use of PQC if sector-specific requirements still require legacy quantum-\n356     vulnerable algorithms. However, hybrid solutions add complexity to implementations and\n357     architectures, which can increase security risks and costs during the transition to PQC. When\n358     used, hybrid solutions are typically expected to be temporary measures that lead to a second\n359     transition to cryptographic tools that use only PQC algorithms.\n360     These trade-offs will vary based on the hybrid techniques used, the applications involved, and\n361     the vendor and user communities that will develop and deploy them. Implementers and\n362     standards organizations that specify cryptographic protocols and technologies need to carefully\n363     consider the security, costs, and complexity of hybrid solutions in their environments.\n364     Industry and standards organizations are considering a variety of techniques for hybrid\n365     solutions with key-establishment schemes and digital signatures. NIST intends to accommodate\n366     the use of hybrid techniques in its cryptographic standards to facilitate the transition to PQC\n367     where their use is desired.\n368     Whether hybrid solutions are used or not, quantum-vulnerable and quantum-resistant\n369     cryptographic algorithms will be fielded and used alongside each other in many applications\n370     and systems during the transition to PQC to facilitate interoperability. For example, many\n371     network security protocols support the use of multiple sets of cryptographic algorithms and\n372     allow two communicating parties to negotiate which algorithms to use in each session.\n373     Similarly, during the transition to PQC, public key infrastructures using quantum-vulnerable\n374     digital signature algorithms are expected to be deployed and used alongside those using\n375     quantum-resistant algorithms. Such approaches are not considered hybrid solutions if each\n376     session only uses a single cryptographic algorithm for key establishment and/or digital\n377     signatures.\n\n378     3.2.1. Hybrid Key-Establishment Techniques\n379     A hybrid key-establishment mode is defined here to be a key establishment scheme that is a\n380     combination of two or more components that are themselves cryptographic key-establishment\n381     schemes. The hybrid key-establishment scheme becomes a composite of these component\n382     schemes.\n383     NIST currently allows a generic composite key-establishment technique described in SP 800-56C\n384     [SP80056C]. Assume that the value Z is a shared secret that was generated as specified by SP\n385     800-56A or 800-56B and that a shared secret T is generated or distributed through other\n386     schemes. The value Z’=Z||T may then be treated as a shared secret and any of the key\n387     derivation methods given in SP 800-56C may be applied to Z’ to derive secret keying material.\n388     NIST intends to update SP 800-56C so that the value Z may be generated as specified by any\n389     current and future NIST key-establishment standards. This will include SP 800-56A, SP 800-56B,\n390     FIPS 203, and any additional post-quantum key-establishment standards. The desired property\n391     of hybrid techniques is that derived keys remain secure if at least one of the component\n392     schemes is secure. Security properties can be complex, and for composite key establishment\n\n                                                   9"

NIST intends to offer guidance on various key combiners in the forthcoming\n395     SP 800-227, Recommendations for Key Encapsulation Mechanisms.\n396     Additionally, the output of the key-establishment scheme specified in FIPS 203 is a shared\n397     secret key which is a shared secret that does not require further key derivation. NIST\n398     emphasizes that any shared secret key generated as specified in FIPS 203 may be used as the\n399     value Z in the generic composite mode described in SP 800-56C. These same properties will\n400     apply to any future FIPS which standardize KEMs.\n\n401     3.2.2. Hybrid Digital Signature Techniques\n402     Common techniques for hybrid digital signatures involve the use of dual signatures, which\n403     consist of two or more signatures on a common message. It may also be known as a hybrid\n404     signature or composite signature. The verification of the dual signature requires all of the\n405     component signatures to be successfully verified, such as by creating a single logical composite\n406     signature from two or more component signature algorithms.\n407     Dual signatures could be used to sign user data (e.g., a document or e-mail) or digital\n408     certificates that contain references to user key pairs within a PKI. Existing NIST standards and\n409     guidelines accommodate their use provided that at least one component digital signature\n410     algorithm is NIST-approved.\n411     NIST leaves the decision to each specific application as to whether it can afford the\n412     implementation cost, performance reduction, and engineering complexity (including proper\n413     and independent security reviews) of a hybrid mode for key establishment or the use of dual\n414     signatures. To assist external parties that desire such a mechanism, NIST will accommodate the\n415     use of a hybrid key-establishment mode and dual signatures in FIPS 140 validation when\n416     suitably combined with a NIST-approved scheme.\n\n10"

Towards a PQC Standards Transition Timeline\n418     NIST’s cryptography standards provide comprehensive guidance on a broad spectrum of\n419     cryptographic mechanisms that are essential for securing sensitive information across both\n420     federal and nonfederal systems. These standards cover fundamental areas that are crucial for\n421     ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data, such as encryption algorithms,\n422     digital signatures, hash functions, key establishment, and random number generation.\n423     Additionally, NIST’s standards define key-management practices and offer frameworks for\n424     securely generating, storing, distributing, and destroying cryptographic keys.\n425     Beyond individual algorithms, NIST standards provide guidance on cryptographic protocols that\n426     secure communications, such as the TLS protocol, which protects internet data exchanges. They\n427     also specify requirements for cryptographic modules through the CMVP to ensure that\n428     implementations meet stringent security standards. NIST has also developed PQC standards to\n429     safeguard systems against future quantum attacks. Through collaboration with industry,\n430     academia, and other stakeholders, NIST continually updates its cryptographic standards to\n431     address evolving security threats and technological advances.\n432     National Security Memorandum 10 (NSM-10) establishes the year 2035 as the primary target\n433     for completing the migration to PQC across Federal systems [NSM10]:\n434      “Any digital system that uses existing public standards for public‑key cryptography, or\n435      that is planning to transition to such cryptography, could be vulnerable to an attack by a\n436      Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). To mitigate this risk, the United\n437      States must prioritize the timely and equitable transition of cryptographic systems to\n438      quantum-resistant cryptography, with the goal of mitigating as much of the quantum\n439      risk as is feasible by 2035.”\n440     This date reflects the urgency of transitioning to cryptographic methods that can withstand\n441     future quantum threats. However, it is important to recognize that migration timelines may\n442     vary based on the specific use case or application. Some systems, particularly those with long-\n443     term confidentiality needs or more complex cryptographic infrastructures, may require earlier\n444     transitions, while others may adopt PQC at a slower pace due to legacy constraints or lower risk\n445     profiles. Flexibility in migration planning is essential to balance the urgency of securing critical\n446     systems with the practical challenges that different sectors face during this transition. NIST will\n447     work to ensure that these varying timelines are acknowledged and supported while maintaining\n448     the overall goal of achieving widespread PQC adoption by 2035.\n\n449     4.1. NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Standards and Guidelines\n450     SP 800-131A [SP800131A] [SP800131A] describes the transitions associated with the use of\n451     cryptography by Federal Government agencies to protect controlled unclassified information.\n452     The document addresses the use of algorithms and key lengths specified in FIPS and NIST SPs.\n453     During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, NIST will revise SP 800-131A with more\n454     detailed guidelines and schedules.\n\n11"

The data owner must examine this risk potential and decide whether\n461         to continue to use a deprecated algorithm or key length.\n462      •  Disallowed means that the algorithm, key length/strength, parameter set, or scheme is\n463         no longer allowed for the stated purpose.\n464      •  Legacy use means that the algorithm, scheme, or parameter set may only be used to\n465         process already protected information (e.g., to decrypt ciphertext data or to verify a\n466         digital signature).\n467\n468     Transition schedules are primarily driven by the level of cryptographic protection that a given\n469     algorithm and associated parameter set can provide, which is described as a rough measure\n470     known as security strength. Historically, the security strength that an algorithm could provide\n471     was defined in terms of the amount of work (i.e., the number of operations) that is required to\n472     break the algorithm (i.e., an algorithm has s bits of security strength if breaking the algorithm\n473     requires 2ˢ operations of some kind, where s = 112, 128, 192, or 256). However, there are\n474     significant uncertainties in estimating the security strengths of post-quantum cryptosystems\n475     given the difficulty of accurately predicting the performance characteristics of future quantum\n476     computers, such as their cost, speed, and memory size.\n477     While NIST guidelines continue to use bit-length security strengths to describe the level of\n478     protection offered by an algorithm and parameter set against attacks by classical computers,\n479     post-quantum security is described using a collection of broad security categories. Each\n480     category is defined by a comparatively easy-to-analyze reference primitive, whose security\n481     serves as a floor for a wide variety of metrics that are deemed potentially relevant to practical\n482     security. NIST based its classification on the range of security strengths offered by the existing\n483     standards in symmetric cryptography. Table 1 provides a summary of these security categories.\n484                            Table 1: Post-Quantum Security Categories\n             Security                              Attack Type               Example\n             Category\n             1           Key search on a block cipher with a 128-bit key     AES-128\n             2           Collision search on a 256-bit hash function         SHA-256\n             3           Key search on a block cipher with a 192-bit key     AES-192\n             4           Collision search on a 384-bit hash function         SHA3-384\n             5           Key search on a block cipher with a 256-bit key     AES-256\n\n12"

At this time, ML-KEM is the\n513     only approved post-quantum key-establishment scheme based on public key cryptography.\n514     Additional algorithms are still being considered as part of the fourth round of the NIST PQC\n515     Standardization process.

Symmetric Cryptography\n520     NIST’s existing standards in symmetric cryptography — including hash functions, XOFs, block\n521     ciphers, KDFs, and DRBGs — are significantly less vulnerable to known quantum attacks than\n522     the public-key cryptography standards in SP 800-56A, SP 800-56B, and FIPS 186. In particular, all\n523     NIST-approved symmetric primitives that provide at least 128 bits of classical security are\n524     believed to meet the requirements of at least Category 1 security within the system of five\n525     security strength categories for evaluating parameter sets in the NIST PQC standardization\n526     process (see Table 1). NIST has a few symmetric cryptography standards at the 112-bit security\n527     level, which will be disallowed in 2030. Applications should move away from these when\n528     transitioning to post-quantum cryptography.\n529                                                Table 6: Block ciphers\n\n                Block Cipher                       Parameter Sets         Security             Security\n                                                                          Strength             Category\n\n         AES                         AES-128                              128 bits                1\n         [FIPS197]                   AES-192                              192 bits                3\n\n                                     AES-256                              256 bits                5\n\n15"

Other Special Publications provide guidance\n539     on the configuration and use of cryptographic technologies, such as NIST SP 800-52 Revision 2\n540     on the use of TLS servers and clients. These standards and guidelines are regularly updated to\n541     address changes to underlying standards and technologies as well as new threats.\n542     Throughout the migration to PQC, NIST will revise its documents to provide more detailed\n543     guidelines for deprecating quantum-vulnerable algorithms, tailored to relevant applications.\n544     While NIST’s cryptographic algorithm standards may continue to specify quantum-vulnerable\n\n16"
