Conclusion\n\nThis report summarizes the evaluation criteria for selecting the fourth-round candidate algorithms, their basic designs, and their advantages and disadvantages. NIST greatly appreciates the participation in the NIST PQC Standardization Process. The announcement of the standardization of HQC marks the end of the fourth round, and also marks an end to the standardization process which began with the NIST Call for Proposals in 2016 [22]. We note that not all NIST PQC standardization is concluded, as NIST is also currently evaluating additional digital signatures [75]. NIST will create a draft standard based on HQC and post it for public comment. After the comments are adjudicated, NIST will publish a final version in approximately two years. The standardization of HQC will be the second PQC KEM after ML-KEM. NIST recently published draft SP 800-227, Recommendations for Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms [76], which describes the basic definitions, properties, and applications of KEMs. It also provides recommendations for implementing and using KEMs in a secure manner.

Scope and Purpose 112 Updating cryptographic technology has occurred many times at different scales, such as 113 increasing key sizes or phasing out insecure hash functions and block ciphers. While the 114 transition to PQC is unprecedented in scale, it benefits from a level of awareness and 115 understanding that previous cryptographic changes did not have. NIST recognizes the 116 complexity of migrating the vast array of systems that currently rely on public-key cryptography 117 and acknowledges that this transition will demand substantial effort across diverse applications 118 and infrastructures with specific requirements and constraints. 119 This report serves as the initial step in a broader strategy to manage and guide the transition to 120 post-quantum cryptography. This transition will involve the adoption of new PQC algorithms as 121 well as the careful deprecation, controlled legacy use, and eventual removal of quantum- 122 vulnerable algorithms that are currently widespread in technological infrastructures. Public- 123 private engagement will be crucial on the path toward PQC. Additionally, this report continues 124 NIST’s ongoing dialogue with industry, standards organizations, and relevant agencies to 125 develop a clear roadmap and realistic timeline for transitioning to PQC.

However, hybrid solutions add complexity to implementations and 357 architectures, which can increase security risks and costs during the transition to PQC. When 358 used, hybrid solutions are typically expected to be temporary measures that lead to a second 359 transition to cryptographic tools that use only PQC algorithms. 360 These trade-offs will vary based on the hybrid techniques used, the applications involved, and 361 the vendor and user communities that will develop and deploy them. Implementers and 362 standards organizations that specify cryptographic protocols and technologies need to carefully 363 consider the security, costs, and complexity of hybrid solutions in their environments. 364 Industry and standards organizations are considering a variety of techniques for hybrid 365 solutions with key-establishment schemes and digital signatures. NIST intends to accommodate 366 the use of hybrid techniques in its cryptographic standards to facilitate the transition to PQC 367 where their use is desired. 368 Whether hybrid solutions are used or not, quantum-vulnerable and quantum-resistant 369 cryptographic algorithms will be fielded and used alongside each other in many applications 370 and systems during the transition to PQC to facilitate interoperability.
