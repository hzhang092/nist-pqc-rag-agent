=== Answer ===
ML-KEM key generation is specified as Algorithm 19 (`ML-KEM.KeyGen`) in FIPS 203 [c2], [c5]. The algorithm accepts no input and generates two 32-byte random seeds, $d$ and $z$, internally [c5]. These seeds are used by an internal key generation algorithm to produce an encapsulation key and a decapsulation key [c5]. FIPS 203 requires that the randomness used in this process be generated using NIST-approved techniques [c1], [c4]. Domain separation was added to the underlying `K-PKE.KeyGen` process to prevent the misuse of keys across different security levels when they are saved as seeds [c1]. While the encapsulation key can be made public, the decapsulation key and the generated seeds are sensitive data that must remain private [c5]. The algorithm expects the chosen parameter set—ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, or ML-KEM-1024—to be stored in global variables [c2], [c5]. Additionally, the indices of matrix A in the underlying `K-PKE.KeyGen` match those used in CRYSTALS-Kyber [c1].

=== Answer ===
* ML-KEM is a Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism used to establish a shared secret key between two parties communicating over a public channel [c3].
* It is a high-performance, general-purpose mechanism based on CRYSTALS-Kyber with theoretical security derived from the presumed hardness of the Module Learning with Errors (MLWE) problem [c2].
* The scheme is composed of three primary algorithms: key generation (ML-KEM.KeyGen), encapsulation (ML-KEM.Encaps), and decapsulation (ML-KEM.Decaps) [c1].
* The mechanism utilizes three specific parameter sets—ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024—to provide different trade-offs between security strength and performance [c5].
* The encapsulation algorithm uses an encapsulation key to generate a shared secret key and an associated ciphertext [c4].
* The encapsulation algorithm requires input checking to ensure the encapsulation key is a valid length and that encoded integers are within the valid range [c6].
